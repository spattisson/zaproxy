# Can ZAP be used to test mobile apps?

Yes, see these videos from [@SecureCloudDev](https://twitter.com/SecureCloudDev):

  * [Setting up ZAP for iPhone/iPad](http://security.force.com/security/tools/webapp/zapiphonesetup)

**Note**:
> On iOS 10.3 and onwards, you also need to enable full trust for the root certificate:

> Go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings.
> Under “Enable full trust for root certificates”, turn on trust for the certificate.
