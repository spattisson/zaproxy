# Root CA issues

**Note**: This is a historic tracking document and should not be relevant to modern versions of Zap.

The dynamic root CA cert generated by ZAP seems to fail on some combination of operating systems and browsers.

Please update this table (alphabetic order) based on the cert generated by the latest code in the `develop` branch (post [b5015af](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/commit/b5015af2b50660b539d5a08c1de6932edaf4aa3e))
