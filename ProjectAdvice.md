# Project Advice

This is general advice for anyone working on ZAP projects, especially students.

For those taking part in the Google Summer of Code also see Google's [DOs and DON'Ts](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html)

  * Keep in regular contact with your mentor(s). If you are working on a major project (eg Google Summer of Code or a Masters project) then you should meet with your mentor(s) at least once a week
  * Ask technical questions on the [ZAP Dev group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) - all of the ZAP core developers are on there, and whoever answers your questions also helps everyone else who belongs to the group
  * Post updates to the [ZAP Dev group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) - it lets everyone know what you're doing and you may get some really useful feedback
  * Plan your work. Decide on a set of phases that you can complete and release, even if they wont do anything 'useful' until a later phase
  * Check code into your zap-extensions fork asap - it allows everyone to see the direction you are going in
  * Create an add-on asap (unless just working in the core) - again, it makes it easier for people to try out your code and give you early feedback
  * Release early and often
  * Develop unit tests as you go
  * Check out the ZAP [Development rules and guidelines](DevGuidelines)
  * Check out the [Hacking ZAP blog series](Development) and other related development articles
